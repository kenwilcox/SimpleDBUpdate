SimpleDBUpdate
==============

A simple way to update your database. This was created two or so years ago. I thought it was a handy little hack.

After going over the code today though, I've realized that it would have been better if I had used an interface and additional classes (hopefully internal).

But it works.

It shows how you can create a calling order of methods.

Lets say you have an object with *N* number of methods and you want the program to figure out the calling order.

This does that.
